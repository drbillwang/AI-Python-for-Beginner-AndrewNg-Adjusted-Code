# AI-Python-for-Beginner-AndrewNg-Adjusted-Code
This repository contains code from Andrew Ngâ€™s AI Python for Beginners course. It has been modified so you can easily run it in your local IDE (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm) instead of a Jupyter Notebook. Please note that you must store your OpenAI API key in an .env file for any AI-related scripts to work.
